      <h2>HEARING THINGS</h2>
      <h5>1/15/2006</h5>
     <p>I know this sounds so stupid, but I swear to god last night I heard my phone talking to me. I know what you’re thinking, no, nobody was calling me, nothing was playing, fucking nothing. It was so weird. I’m guessing it was something like maybe when I switched my phone number something got left over or transferred through? I have no idea. I just hope it doesn’t happen again so I don’t have to go back to the mall and return this stupid thing. </p><br>


<p>Hope you like the new look.

      <h2>NEW PHONE</h2>
      <h5>1/14/2006</h5>
     

<p>Finally upgraded my shitty pay-to-go phone to a phone with a full keyboard! I got an LG The V!</p><br>

<p>It’s no blackberry, but with a full keyboard and a 1.3 megapixel camera, I should have more than enough to do with this thing. Hopefully I can use it to take some pics on the go instead of worrying about losing my camera.

      <h2>CASTLEVANIA</h2>
      <h5>1/12/2006</h5>


<p>While being nostalgic about the Playstation earlier, I decided to sit down and pop in Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, one of my all-time favorite games. Holy shit, it’s just as good, if not better than I remember. 
1[]

The game begins with you fully decked-out with all your powers and abilities so you can appreciate when they are almost instantly ripped away from you to start your journey. Not to mention the kickass soundtrack that accompanies the entire experience, with Lost Painting and Dracula’s Castle being standouts for me. 

[music] 

Although the flipped castle seems a bit tedious after such an excellent first half, the whole game front to back is a marvel. Although it really can’t be compared to the classic Castlevania games, SOTN is definitely one of the best in the series.

      <h2>RAMBLINGS</h2>
      <h5>1/24/2006</h5>
      <p>Ever since hanging out with Mike and Sam a few days ago I’ve been feeling so weird about the future. I’m almost upset that I like them so much and that we can’t just have the same friendship we had freshman year forever. Like, I know logically we all grow and change, but I hate to think that we’ll never have a weekend like that again. I wish I could replay it and relive it forever and I’m so afraid of forgetting it. It makes me feel a little less crazy for fantasizing about our lives existing as data after all. I don’t know.  </p>

      <h2>FRIENDS AGAIN</h2>
      <h5>1/21/2006</h5>
      <p>Me, Mike, and Sam hung out all together for the first time in what seemed like forever. Mike has been so busy fighting with or avoiding his parents I feel like we never see him anymore, so it was great to kick back in the basement, play GTA, and listen to music for a few hours on a friday night. I think we’ve all been feeling a little disconnected from each other now that we’re in our last semester in high school, and Sam is for sure moving to the west coast for some biology degree. It was just nice to be together again in one place.
