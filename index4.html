      <h2>HEARING THINGS</h2>
      <h5>1/15/2006</h5>
     <p>I know this sounds so stupid, but I swear to god last night I heard my phone talking to me. I know what you’re thinking, no, nobody was calling me, nothing was playing, fucking nothing. It was so weird. I’m guessing it was something like maybe when I switched my phone number something got left over or transferred through? I have no idea. I just hope it doesn’t happen again so I don’t have to go back to the mall and return this stupid thing. </p><br>


<p>Hope you like the new look.

      <h2>NEW PHONE</h2>
      <h5>1/14/2006</h5>
     

<p>Finally upgraded my shitty pay-to-go phone to a phone with a full keyboard! I got an LG The V!</p><br>

<p>It’s no blackberry, but with a full keyboard and a 1.3 megapixel camera, I should have more than enough to do with this thing. Hopefully I can use it to take some pics on the go instead of worrying about losing my camera.

      <h2>CASTLEVANIA</h2>
      <h5>1/12/2006</h5>


<p>While being nostalgic about the Playstation earlier, I decided to sit down and pop in Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, one of my all-time favorite games. Holy shit, it’s just as good, if not better than I remember. 
<center><img src="sotn.jpg" height="400 px"></center><br>


The game begins with you fully decked-out with all your powers and abilities so you can appreciate when they are almost instantly ripped away from you to start your journey. Not to mention the kickass soundtrack that accompanies the entire experience, with Lost Painting and Dracula’s Castle being standouts for me.

Although the flipped castle seems a bit tedious after such an excellent first half, the whole game front to back is a marvel. Although it really can’t be compared to the classic Castlevania games, SOTN is definitely one of the best in the series.

      <h2>FAMILY, FRIENDS, SCHOOL</h2>
      <h5>1/09/2006</h5>
      <p>I wanted to dedicate a post to introducing myself a little bit more in-depth to whoever cares. My name is Charlie Collins and I was born on August 24th, 1988 in Ann Arbor, Michigan before moving to Medford, Massachusetts when I was 3. My mom, Lorraine, is a nurse, and my dad Robert, is a computer engineer. I’m an only child. </p>

I’ve always been fascinated with games and technology for as long as I can even remember almost entirely because of my Dad. He’s a huge nerd himself and that’s why I am the way I am today. From playing DOOM on his dial-up PC as a kid, to begging him for my first Playstation, to him helping teach me to program simple games in C++ for fun, he’s always helped me get better at whatever all of this is. He’s actually the one who encouraged me to start a blog, although I wouldn't dare show him this. 

I’ve never had that many friends, but I’ve had the same two since middle school: Mike and Sam. Mike is a stubborn asshole but my best friend in the world, and Sam is the mom of the group. Both of them are kind of punks, but we all don’t fit in together. I’ve been hanging out more with Sam recently because Mike is trying to figure out what he’s doing after school since he doesn’t want to go to college and fights with his parents constantly about it. Sam has her life way more figured out, but won’t even play Mario Kart with me, so there’s good and bad with both. 

Like I said before, we’re all (well hopefully Mike) about to graduate high school. Everyone is crazy busy applying to colleges and taking exams, but I just feel like I’m floating alongside them all in my own world. I’m going to apply to the state school nearby and hopefully test out of some programming classes, but I don’t think college will teach me anything that I want to know. I just think everything I want to do is going to be learned by my own hand.

      <h2>H.R. GIGER + KORN</h2>
      <h5>1/08/2006</h5>
      <p>In my last post I mentioned Korn’s latest album,See You On the Other Side. Although the lead vocalist Jonathan Davis’ style isn’t what I would want to emulate myself, he is in possession of one of the coolest pieces of functional artwork I have ever seen: a biomechanical microphone stand designed by none other than swiss artist H.R. Giger. 
       <center><img src="mic.jpg" ></center> <br>


If you couldn’t immediately tell, HRG is the artist responsible for the Xenomorph design from Alien, among many other legendary pieces, like his Harkonnen chairs. 
The microphone itself is so striking and unique, and fits the essence of what Korn is perfectly.

If you’re interested, you can check out what HRG wrote himself about the project on his website. Very cool stuff. <br>
