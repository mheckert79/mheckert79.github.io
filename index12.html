      <h2>CONTINUED</h2>
      <h5>5/29/2006</h5>
      <p>It’s been a while since my last post for obvious reasons. I’ve been trying to log off and forget about what happened to process it all but I just can’t. I’m getting ready to move into my new dorm soon and I just can’t continue to think about this blog or anything that might happen. </p>

<p>What changed? <br>
When did it happen?<br>
Was it in an instant? A slow descent into selfishness?<br>
 How does who I am today become that….thing? </p>

<p>He wasn’t me but I know in my heart that he was. 
All I can do now is hope that knowing what I do now I don’t end up like that.
I won’t. I can’t.</p>

<p>I’m sure nobody even reads this anymore and the few who do think I’m insane. 
At least I’ll know what whatever the fuck happened is immortalized here. </p>

<p>I think this is a good place to leave this blog, as a testament to a future I’m trying to prevent.</p>

<p>He’s completely stopped interfering but the damage is done. I don’t feel sane. My friends hate me, they’re not even my friends anymore. None of this makes sense and it would be easier to just forget if that were even remotely possible,  </p>

      <h2>THE TRUTH</h2>
      <h5> 5/05/2006</h5>
      <p>The idea that there exists a future where I will grow into a monster haunts my every thought, moment, and move. I truly can’t tell if the knowledge of what I might become does more to influence me towards that future or away from it, and that thought in itself keeps me up at night.I’m truly the only one who knows how dangerous this is. </p>
<p>It’s me. I’m the dangerous one. I don’t know when I become him but he is real and he is trying to get me to put my life at stake for his own personal gain. He is a selfish monster. And he is me. </p>

<p>I might as well post this because I know he’s reading this and I know it doesn’t matter anymore, and more so I know nobody will ever believe a word I say about this so there’s really no point.</p> 

<p>He’s 86 years old and about to die. He has spent his entire life working on a so-called revolutionary worldwide internet protocol and systemic structure that will allow for every individual on earth to sync their consciousness to it. And it’s about to work, with every single one of the billions of people on Earth in 2092 about to upload their entire lives to this god-like, impossible server.</p>

<p>The catch is, unbeknownst to everyone but me, uploading their consciousness to suit this protocol will kill them. This, according to myself, is to preserve mankind as we know it before the Earth simply becomes uninhabitable as a result of our own destruction. </p>

<p>But it wasn’t that simple for me, was it? He had to make sure this would work, and he didn’t have much time left. People were getting a little suspicious of our mythical promised land here.  Unfortunately, years of smoking cigarettes will eventually get you (me), and I only had a few more hours to live. So what do I do, the genius I am? Upload time. </p>

<p>Now me, being said genius, needs to guarantee this project will proceed without him. And the best way to do this, apparently, is creating and infiltrating various versions of this protocol based on archaic internet systems. For those of you who have no idea what I’m talking about, I’m the one who has been ruining my own fucking life. </p>

<p>Beyond literally injecting code into my text editor and fucking up my relationships with my childhood best friend, the girl I’m in love with, and taking away from me 4 months+ of existing like a normal human being, I’m not sure what he (I) did actually accomplished anything. He hasn’t given any indication he is going to stop but who the fuck knows anymore. This has reached beyond all comprehension. </p>

<p>I found out who was communicating with me. I’ve been so physically ill with this knowledge that I’ve considered not finishing school. I don’t know what to do, or who to tell, or who to trust. The world is falling apart at the seems and I’m the only one who knows. </p>
