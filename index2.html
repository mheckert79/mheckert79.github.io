      <h2>BENDING THE WORLD AROUND ME</h2>
      <h5>12/07/2005</h5>
      <p>One thing I forgot to mention in my other databending posts was how I use Audacity to bend my files and how really any format, not only pictures, can be databent. One example of this is that when I convert an image into . TIFF format, I can then import that raw data to Audacity, an free audio editing software. Because Audacity interprets the numerical data that composes the picture as audio, you get a waveform that you can listen to! Below is the databent image, as well as what it sounds like. </p><br>

<p>This also got me pontificating about extrapolating this idea to real life. I’ve always loved the sci-fi concept of uploading everyone’s consciousness to the same server, creating a perfect recreation of our own life. Would it still be “real”? Would this perfect recreation be real if life on earth ceased to exist elsewhere? </p>

<p>I know this is kind of a lot, but databending always gets me thinking this way. What if we could reduce everything to more simpler terms to reconstruct them again in a better, or more interesting way? </p>

      <h2>Drama</h2>
      <h5>12/04/2005</h5>
      <p>More of a personal post: I can’t stand needless high school drama. 
Mike and I got into a massive argument about something as stupid as which 7th generation console we’re going to buy next year. I’m of course going to get a PS3 because I have no faith in Microsoft to improve on what the Xbox currently is and I’ve been loyal to Sony for years, but Mike is pretty dead-set on a 360. This wouldn’t be a problem if that didn’t mean we wouldn’t be able to play 7th gen games together online, which is practically the biggest selling point of these systems! </p>

      <h2>ABOUT DATABENDING</h2>
      <h5>11/18/05</h5>
      <p>As I mentioned before, I’m pretty into the art of databending. For those unfamiliar with the concept, it’s taking the raw data of anything (usually an image, but only certain formats work) and reconfiguring it into something new. Like I said, I love that it reminds us that everything we experience on the web can be reduced to data—just numbers on a screen with no meaning unless put together in the right way.</p>

<P>One of the more common, and my personal favorite utilization of this, is using databending to create glitched-out freaky edits of pictures found online. As you could probably tell, I love using screenshots from my favorite anime series, like Neon Genesis Evangelion and Serial Experiments Lain.

      <h2>Sony Vs All</h2>
      <h5>11/18/05</h5>
      <p>For Christmas, my family finally upgraded our 13” CRT that we had in our living room to a gigantic 48” incher with a VCR included, which means I got our white Trinitron all to myself. </p>

<p>It took a ton of convincing, but my parents finally let me, as practically an autonomous adult, have a  TV set in my own room. The perfect white Sony Trinitron that we watched so much television on is now my own personal gaming machine. </p><br><br>

<center><img src="tv.jpg" height="400 px"></center> <br><br>
<br>

<p>The new Mitsubishi TV we bought is nice, but the clarity is nothing compared to the Sony that now resides in my room. I understand my parents don't understand the value of image clarity, but that’s all to my own benefit. I’m looking forward to playing my playstation all night by TV light without disturbing a soul.
