      <h2>SEEING THINGS AGAIN</h2>
      <h5>3/12/2006</h5>
      <p>I don’t know what the fuck is going on. It’s not just my phone anymore—I swear to god that I took a break from programming a project I have going dealing with theoretically linked neuron transmittals to  Schumann resonances somehow, and when I came back to my computer after a short nap, half of my work was completed. I have never slept walked in my whole life, let alone slept programmed code that I barely even know how and why it works. That’s not even all true, some of the code works, some of it’s out of order, some of my code is deleted, and I have no idea what to fucking make of any of this. Here’s some of the code that got added. Please send me an email at charlie@arlia.com if you have any idea what this, how it works, or why it exists.</p>

      <h2>GOECACHING WITH SAM</h2>
      <h5>3/09/2006</h5>
      <p>Our first trip Geocaching was a wild success! We found two different caches, and even traded a pokemon card for a pokemon figure! We had an absolute blast digging through the woods just like we were kids again, getting covered in thorns and sticking out hands in trees.

Sam kept mentioning how different it is to hang out with me in person instead of texting me or AIM. Everyone seems to act like I have a split personality when it comes to being online and being in person, when I really don’t see a huge difference or one at all. I feel like existing online is just two sides of the same coin. I don’t really see the problem. After all, staying so connected is how I was able to get that video of us today.

      <h2>ABOUT GEOCACHING</h2>
      <h5>3/07/2006</h5>
      <p>I found more about the GPS treasure hunt and it’s even cooler than I could have imagined. <br>
Straight from the website FAQs[link]: </p>


<p>“Geocaching is an entertaining adventure game for gps users. Participating in a cache hunt is a good way to take advantage of the wonderful features and capability of a gps unit. The basic idea is to have individuals and organizations set up caches all over the world and share the locations of these caches on the internet. GPS users can then use the location coordinates to find the caches. Once found, a cache may provide the visitor with a wide variety of rewards. All the visitor is asked to do is if they get something they should try to leave something for the cache.”</p>

<p>Sam and I are going to take our old pokemon cards and go Geocaching this weekend. I can’t wait.

      <h2>HARD RESET</h2>
      <h5>2/21/2006</h5>
     

<p>I took my phone into the Verizon Wireless store and they did a full reset of the device to make sure nothing was wrong with it, and to assure me that there was no way someone could gain access to my phone like that.

      <h2>SPRING THOUGHTS</h2>
      <h5>3/04/2006</h5>
     <p>With the weather getting nicer and being so affected by all of this online/offline bullshit, I think I’m going to make it a point to go outside more as the weather finally breaks in a few weeks. </p>

<p>I’ve been thinking more and more about what I want to do with my life and I’m not so sure of the potential of needing to replicate the human experience as much as a desire to enhance the existing aspects. As to what that means, I’m not sure. I just know that by creating an alternate reality identical to the one we live in now doesn’t help people like Mike. Maybe there’s a concept out there that I can pursue that would serve to do even more than what I initially thought was the ultimate goal. Or maybe I’m just rambling and will be stuck at a desk job until I die. Who knows. </p>
