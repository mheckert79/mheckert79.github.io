      <h2>SPOKE TOO SOON</h2>
      <h5>3/30/2006</h5>
      <p>Sam is furious at me. She said I’ve been lying to her and that she doesn’t even want to see my face anymore. I don’t know what I did. I don’t know if I said something wrong yesterday? I don’t even remember what we talked about yesterday when I think about it. Maybe not trusting my own sanity wasn’t the best case scenario I’d hoped for. I’m going to try and keep better track of this blog to hold myself, and my own memory, accountable. </p>

      <h2>NORMALCY WITH SAM</h2>
      <h5>3/29/2006</h5>
      <p>Finally got a chance to go to the local nature reserve with Sam the other day for the first time in forever. She seemed worried about me instead of angry for a change, but I couldn’t for the life of me bring myself to tell her what’s wrong. I’m starting to think I actually just dreamt all of this, or the eventual psychosis that will hit me is just starting early. Having dreamt all of this would be so much easier than it being real, for my sake, and especially for Sam.

      <h2>BUSY WITH SCHOOL</h2>
      <h5>3/26/2006</h5>
      <p>My grades have been tanking since the code incident earlier this month, so I’ve been spending most of my time recently catching up on work and trying not to fall further behind. Things are depressing, but things are normal, and I would rather have depressingly normal than living in a  horrible nightmare.

      <h2>DISTRACTIONS</h2>
      <h5>3/22/2006</h5>
     

<p>I’ve been staying off the internet and it’s been for the better. Tensions are still really high with Sam, and Mike is beyond even caring to look at me anymore. I spend most of my time just sitting in my bed staring at pages of books trying to forget about anything that’s happened this year. I can’t even read sci-fi anymore because it all feels too painfully close to home. I’ve been settling for murder mysteries, for a lighter ambiance for a change (that’s a joke).

      <h2>WRONG WRONG WRONG</h2>
      <h5>3/13/2006</h5>
  

<p>After reviewing the code and finding absolutely nothing, I kept it in a second file and just stopped the project. I don’t know what’s happening, but I’m starting to feel less and less sure that I’m conscious of everything I’m doing. All the things Mike said months ago, Sam being so concerned about me being online, none of this makes sense.
I keep checking, double-checking, and triple checking all my files and texts on the regular just to make sure there aren’t things changing, but now I check so often that I think my brain might be seeing things appear and disappear on its own. I don’t know what's going on or who to even talk to about this. Sam and Mike already don’t like how all of this is making me act, and my parents will commit me to mental institution. I’m just going to stop this all together and take a break from all of this (maybe even the blog) until I know what the fuck is going on.
