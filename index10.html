      <h2>SAM</h2>
      <h5>4/14/2006</h5>
      <p>I finally caved and told Sam about what’s going on. I haven’t been eating or sleeping because this entire ordeal has been tearing me apart physically and emotionally. 
The best part? She doesn’t believe a goddamn word. She barely even agreed to listen to me speak. Clearly I personally wronged in some irreparable way without my knowledge, which seems to be really in style this year. Fucking awesome. Fucking fanstastic. I guess I’ll go stare at my ceiling.

      <h2>WAITING</h2>
      <h5>4/04/2006</h5>
      <p>I have spent every available moment monitoring my devices to record what’s happening when it happens again. I know something is wrong and someone is fucking with me and I need to know why. It can barely eat or sleep. I just want to know why this person is fucking with my code, and porbably my whole life. I know I sound crazy and you know what, I probably am, but there is someone out there who is trying to ruin my life through the one thing I used to enjoy. I’m going to find out who is doing this. If you’re reading this, and I know you are, I’m coming for you.

      <h2>FUCK</h2>
      <h5>4/16/2006</h5>
  

<p> I was wrong about everything I said before, and I was seconds away from being able to prove it. I don’t know if I should even be posting this, but I guarantee someone is fucking with my phone and my computer without my knowledge or my consent. It’s not in my head because I saw my text editor with my own two eyes replace code in an instant, even while I had control of the mouse. I’ve had every camera we own set up to monitor my screens in the event that this happened, but my quick deploy wasn’t fast enough for what happened. This is beyond hacking, this is someone invading my computer for THIS. </p>

Why would somebody be doing this? As a fucking prank? I don’t understand why someone is trying to get me to finish this fucking program that I started out of boredom with my stupid fucking life.
