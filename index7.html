      <h2>NOT A ROBOT</h2>
      <h5>3/02/2006</h5>
      <p>After the whole ordeal with Mike the other week, I’ve been in a really weird mental place. I feel like I’ve been so invested in what I want to do and achieve for so long that I might have been neglecting my friends emotions. Still, he handles his emotions like a child, so I don’t feel entirely responsible for them.

      <h2>MELEE + MELEE</h2>
      <h5>2/26/2006</h5>
      <p>I had Mike over to play one of our all-time favorites today: Smash Brothers Melee. Even though neither of us are big Nintendo heads nowadays, when we were younger, this was all we ever played. I play Fox McCloud, and he plays Falco Lombardi, naturally. I thought this would be a great way to actually reconnect and have some escapist fun, but after losing like 3 games in a row, Mike absolutely blew up at me., which is nothing new. 
This time it was different though. He was genuinely upset. And it wasn’t about the game. He kept yelling about how I never think about him and it wasn’t even really coherent, but he ended with saying he didn’t even know who I was anymore and how I never even respond to his calls, which doesn’t make sense as he hasn’t called me in weeks. He just stormed out and left me here to feel like shit. I don’t think I did anything wrong, but I can’t help but feel like this is my fault. I know he’s going through some stuff right now, but I don’t know if there’s anything I can do to help him right now other than tell Sam.

      <h2>HARD RESET</h2>
      <h5>2/21/2006</h5>
     

<p>I took my phone into the Verizon Wireless store and they did a full reset of the device to make sure nothing was wrong with it, and to assure me that there was no way someone could gain access to my phone like that.

      <h2>STRANGE NIGHTS</h2>
      <h5> 2/20/2006</h5>
     <p>Remember a few months ago when I swear I heard my phone talking to me unprompted? Well it gets fucking weirder. I swear on my fucking life that when I pulled up a text to Sam, the phone began typing on its own. I have no idea how some hacker got access to my phone but I’m positive this is all either some crazy misunderstanding or a hacker. All that was typed was </p>

<p>~~~~~~~~#####</p>

<p>Before erasing itself almost instantly. I have no idea what the fuck is going on but I’m bringing my phone in for a replacement as sonon as possible. I don’t want anyone stealing my phone numbers and selling them to telemarketing companies or something way worse.
