      <h2>VISUAL KEI</h2>
      <h5>Nov 28, 2005</h5>
      <p>Like I mentioned previously, I’m very interested in Japanese culture, specifically anime, manga, and music. One of my favorite genres of visual-kei, or v-kei, which is basically the japanese equivalent of hair metal, in my opinion. One of the biggest v-kei bands I know about from browsing web forums is Malice Mizer, who just put out a music video for Gardenia.</p>

<p>I think it’s such a dramatic, emotional, and melancholy piece. Yes it’s dramatic, but it has a reason to be, only accentuated by the performer. I think it’s great and I hope you do too.</p>

      <h2>CELL PICS</h2>
      <h5>Nov 28, 2005</h5>
      My dad finally let me have his Canon digital camera since he got a brand new one for himself. <br>
Of course I had to start by seeing how well it could pick up my prized possession since childhood, my Blue Eyes Black Dragon 

<p>Yu-Gi-Oh card. I can’t quite get a handle on the flash and macro settings just yet, but I was too excited not to share a decent photo of my card. Here’s to better pictures coming soon. </p><br>

      <h2>A FEW OF MINE...</h2>
      <h5>Nov 28, 2005</h5>
      <p>I realized that I might have dove too soon into some of my more niche hobbies, so I wanted to take a second to introduce myself a little bit more in-depth. </p>

<p>I’m Charlie, and as you can tell, I love all things tech and cyberpunk, so naturally I watch a lot of anime and play a ton of japanese games. My favorite anime of all time is Serial Experiments Lain, which I’m sure i’ll talk about in a later post. I also really appreciate the depth of Neon Genesis Evangelion, even if my best friend Mike doesn’t understand it. </p>

      <br><center><img src="lain.jpg" height="200 px"><img src="psy.jpg" height="200 px"><img src="nge.jpg" height="200 px"><img src="ff7.jpg" height="200 px"><img src="matrix.jpg" height="200 px"></center><br>

<p>I also love JRPGs like FF VII, but I’ll play anything new and cool on the PlayStation from Crash Bandicoot to Tony Hawk.</p> 

<p>In terms of music, my friends describe my tastes as “goth,” but I’m pretty sure that’s because I only wear black. My favorite album right now is I PSYDOLL by Psydoll, as it’s everything I love about the cyberpunk scene and japanese culture. </p>

<p>The last thing on my list is, of course, the matrix. Do I really have to say any more about this masterpiece and why I love it? I don’t think so.</p>

      <h2>THINGS I'VE MADE</h2>
      <h5>Nov 20, 2005</h5>
      <p>As you can probably tell by my custom headers and assets for this site, I’m pretty into making digital art. My inspiration almost always comes from the world around me, which is primarily on the web.</p>

<p>As far as my skills, I’m slowly learning Adobe CS2 but I’m no expert (yet). I’ve grown up with Microsoft Paint and even importing raw data in Audacity to alter it, so I’m pretty confident I can work my way around anything given enough time.</p>

<p>I’m also hugely inspired by 80’s anime and cyberpunk culture, which is why I love editing the raw data of files into something new. The entire process just reminds me that everything in life can be reduced to something simpler, be it 1s and 0s, or emotions to a man. </p>

<p>Here are some examples of work I’ve done in the past few months. 
I hope you like them, because there’s more to come. </p> <br>
