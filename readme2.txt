Author's description:

I have created a "Nuclear Symbols" cursor set for animated Busy wheels cursors. This set is based on the Nuclear sign.

I gave credit to the original author on the RealWorld website named LabRat120 to re-use his "Gamma Pro Cursor - Busy.ani", so that I could re-color this Nuclear symbol so that I could make a cursor set from it.

Here is LabRat120's Gamma Pro Black And Yellow Cursors: http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-set/gamma-pro-black-and-yellow

As proof, I did not steal this cursor: www.rw-designer.com/cursor-detail/143025

This cursor set is animated. Make sure to preview it using Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome. The animations wont play with Internet Explorer 11.
