      <h2>MUSIC</h2>
      <h5>1/06/2006</h5>
      <p>As a final sort of recommendation, I just wanted to list off some of my favorite albums.<br>
Note that although most my friends call my music taste goth, I like everything from rock to rap to electronic music, so be prepared. Genre labels tend to blur when you like more underground music anyway.</p>

<p>Pretty Hate Machine - Nine Inch Nails</p>

<p>Demon Days - Gorillaz</p>


<p>Lullabies to Paralyze - Queens of the Stone Age </p>


<p>India - XANDRIA</p>


<p>I PSYDOLL - PSYDOLL</p>


<p>Oxidizer - Chemlab</p>


<p>See You On the Other Side - Korn</p>


<p>Hope you like them. </p>

      <h2>ANIME</h2>
      <h5> 1/03/2006</h5>
      <p>School starts back up tomorrow but I’m going to continue my set of recommendations. </p>
<p>I know I’ve mentioned Neon Genesis Evangelion before as one of my all-time favorite anime series of all time, but my true favorite is actually even less mainstream than NGE. 
Serial Experiments Lain is an absolute clusterfuck of cyberpunk, electronic music, virtual and literal suicide, plus cute anime girls in bear hats.</p>

The series is hard to spoil because for most people it’s pretty unintelligible on the first watchthrough, but it sticks in your mind like glue to analyze and overanalyze again. I don’t even want to reveal more about the series, you just have to trust me and watch. 
Now that I’m writing this post, maybe I’ll do some commentary posts during a watch later on when things get less busy with school again. </p>

      <h2>BOOKS & NEW YEARS</h2>
      <h5> 1/01/2006</h5>
      <p>Happy New Years everyone!</p>
      <center><img alt="newyear" src="snoop.gif" height="200 px"><br><br></center>

<p>I figured since I’ve been relaxing before getting back to school I’d continue my media recommendation posts. 
My favorite book of all time is by far Invisible Monsters by Chuck Palahniuk, who more famously wrote Fight Club. 
Although just as gritty, darkly funny, and disgusting as Fight Club, I think Invisible Monsters has a much more human, real, and relatable core. Not to say I’ve ever had birds eat half my face or...anything like that, but the book reads like poetry for the lonely without ever losing it’s dark humor. Highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart.

      <h2>TV</h2>
      <h5>12/30/2005</h5>
     

<p>Since I’m still off of school, I’ve had time to catch up on some TV. 
I started watching my parent’s tapes of The Office again, and on the second try, it’s actually really funny. When I first tried watching I couldn’t handle Michael Scott’s stupidity, it made me too uncomfortable to even laugh. This time, knowing what I was getting into, I was able to relax a bit and laugh my ass off at Jim and Dwight’s antics. Not a deep show, but nice to put on and zone out to for a good laugh.

      <h2>XMAS + UPDATES</h2>
      <h5>12/26/2005</h5>
     <p>Merry belated christmas to everyone, I hope it didn’t suck. </p>

<p>I hope you’ve all noticed with some time off from school I’ve made a few quality of life improvements to the site. The page navigation will hopefully be needed as I continue to blog, so that’s more thinking ahead. I’ve also finally implemented the marquee at the top and bottom of the site without it crashing or failing to loop, which I’ve been working on for quite some time. </p><br>
 <center><img alt="xmas" src="xmas.gif" height="200 px"><br><br></center><br>

<p>Hope you like the new look.
